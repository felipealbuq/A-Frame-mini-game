## Getting Started

First, clone this repository:

```bash
https://github.com/felipealbuq/A-Frame-mini-game.git
```

Open the file index.html and you need some live preview server, then open the browser and see the result.

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to create an interactive **Mini Game** using **A-frame**, focusing on **movements**, **animations**, and **physics colliders** to deliver an engaging 3D experience directly in the browser. This project aims to:

- Demonstrate my ability to work with **A-frame** for building immersive 3D environments.
- Showcase the integration of **movement mechanics** and **animations** for character or object interactions within the game.
- Implement **physics colliders** to add realism to the environment, ensuring proper detection of object collisions and interactions.
- Highlight the potential of Web-based 3D games using modern technologies that are lightweight and accessible.

This mini game serves as a proof of concept for developing more complex interactive 3D applications for the web, emphasizing user interaction and physics-based gameplay.
